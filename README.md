# TICKET-XPRESS

**TICKET-XPRESS** is a bus reservation system built using **C++** with **graph algorithms**, **stacks**, **queues**, and **arrays** to efficiently manage routes and seat allocations. It provides **real-time ticket booking, instant seat cancellation, and seamless ticket exchanges** while ensuring optimized performance with **O(1) time complexity** for critical operations.

## Features

- **Graph-Based Route Management**: Implements **BFS & DFS** for shortest path calculation across **6 routes**.
- **Efficient Seat Allocation**: Manages up to **100 passengers** with stack, queue, and parent-tracking arrays.
- **Real-Time Booking & Cancellation**: Instantly books, cancels, or exchanges seats with minimal processing time.
- **Automated Reservation System**: Handles payments and prevents overbooking scenarios.
- **Optimized Performance**: Utilizes **O(1) time complexity** for seat assignment and processing.

## Technologies & Algorithms Used

- **Language**: C++  
- **Data Structures**: Graphs, Stacks, Queues, Arrays  
- **Algorithms**: BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search)  
- **Memory Management**: Efficient data handling for smooth execution  

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TICKET-XPRESS.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd TICKET-XPRESS
   ```
3. **Compile the C++ program** (Using g++ or any C++ compiler):
   ```bash
   g++ -o ticket_xpress main.cpp
   ```
4. **Run the executable**:
   ```bash
   ./ticket_xpress
   ```
5. **Follow on-screen instructions** for booking, canceling, or modifying reservations.

## How It Works

- **Route Calculation**: Uses **BFS & DFS** to determine the shortest and most efficient routes.  
- **Seat Allocation**: Implements **stack and queue** structures for optimized seat management.  
- **Real-Time Processing**: Ensures near-instant updates with an efficient reservation system.  
- **Overbooking Prevention**: Automated checks prevent errors and ensure seamless transactions.
